# pwncollege-userscript

This is a userscript that tweaks the appearance of some elements on [pwn.college](https://pwn.college) for those that find the default appearance to be a bit hard on the eyes.

## Installation

Userscripts are small scripts that can be run in your browser to modify the appearance or behavior of a webpage.  In order to use a userscript, you will need a userscript manager.

Please see the following link to find a userscript manager for your setup: [https://openuserjs.org/about/Userscript-Beginners-HOWTO](https://openuserjs.org/about/Userscript-Beginners-HOWTO)

## Contributing

Visual design is not my strong suit, so if you have any suggestions for improvements, please feel free to open an issue or a pull request.  Hopefully, this can converge to a set of tweaks that most people find helpful.
